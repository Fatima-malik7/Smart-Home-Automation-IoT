# Smart-Home-Automation-IoT
This project demonstrates a Smart Home Automation System designed and implemented in Cisco Packet Tracer. The system integrates IoT devices to provide seamless control and automation of home appliances, improving convenience, security, and energy efficiency.

Features
Remote Device Control:
Control smart devices like lights, fans, windows, and doors via a smartphone app or a web interface.

IoT Integration:
Connect multiple IoT devices, such as:

Smart Light Bulbs.
Ceiling Fans.
Smart Doors with RFID access.
Temperature-controlled AC.
Automation Features:

Lights turn on automatically when the door opens.
RFID-based door access for added security.
Temperature-based AC automation for energy efficiency.
Multi-Device Access:
Control devices from smartphones, tablets, or laptops wirelessly using a centralized system.

Tools & Technologies
Simulation Software: Cisco Packet Tracer
Devices Used:
DLC 100 Home Gateway
Smart Light Bulb, Ceiling Fan, Window, Door
RFID Reader for access control
Wireless Router and Switch
End Devices: Smartphone, Tablet, Laptop
Protocols: IoT protocols for device communication and control

Setup Instructions
